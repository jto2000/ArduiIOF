Goal :

For each notified beacon, user might clic a button when it was found
If the position is correct, a clear signal shall be sent to user (green led)
-> Possibility to blink if < 10m
If not also (red led) !

The user might be able to calibrate the first point with another button ? => yellow led ?

The position is computed with GPS
The beacon are stored in SD card, in LAT/LON or in distance vs Origin
A circle of tolerance could be defined
Different mode can be computed ? Indicate the direction, blink when in, ordred beacons etc...
