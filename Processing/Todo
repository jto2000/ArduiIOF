Goals :

Be able to load a map (at least 1, better more layers, to merge and suppress existing beacons)

Be able to point and click a new beacon

If geolocalized map => compute position and save it in file (to put on SD card)
If not => User shall define a origin beacon point, clearly identifiable on map
Soft shall compute the distance and heading of each point, to give the possibility to compute position with embedded sw

Shall be able to print the map

Shall be able to move the points on the map ?
